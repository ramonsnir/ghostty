// (ramon fork / Agent Queue Supervisor) Shared queue types. Mirrors the locked
// design spec (§4–§14). These are the JSON shape of a queue TEMPLATE (team policy,
// §5), the WorkItem the genericity-boundary providers emit (§5), and the runtime
// Assignment + its state-machine (§6) the supervisor tracks and persists (§9).
//
// PURE type declarations only — no I/O, no behavior. The genericity invariant
// (the #1 requirement) is expressed in the types: a provider is a command (argv
// array, JSON over stdout); item fields reach the agent as ENV VARS, never spliced
// into a shell line. NOTHING here is Linear/Git/issue-key aware.
