/**
 * Choose which work items to dispatch THIS round, respecting every cap and the

 * EMIT ORDER (the template controls priority via its query sort); an item is SKIPPED
 * when ANY of:
 *   - its key is already in the `active` set (the in-memory + reconciled active map,
 *     keyed by work-item key — covers within-tick AND cross-restart dedup);
 *   - its key is in `cooldown` with an `until` strictly in the future (`nowMs <
 *     until`) — a just-finished key is held so a stale `list` can't immediately
 *     re-dispatch it (§6 COOLDOWN); an expired cooldown entry no longer blocks;
 *   - a DUPLICATE key already chosen earlier in THIS selection round (a flaky
 *     provider can emit the same key twice in one list — we dispatch it once).
 *
 * The result is capped by BOTH `remainingSlots` (= the smaller of remaining
 * concurrency and remaining grid capacity, computed by the caller) AND
 * `maxItemsRemaining` (the run's lifetime `maxItems` budget minus dispatches so
 * far). A non-positive cap yields `[]`.
 *
 * ── WITHIN-TICK DEDUP INVARIANT (load-bearing, §7) ──────────────────────────────
 * This function is PURE and reads `active` ONCE. It returns up to N candidates, but
 * the caller dispatches them one at a time and MUST insert each chosen key into the
 * `active` map SYNCHRONOUSLY (before awaiting that spawn) so a later candidate in
 * the SAME returned batch — or a later sweep before `list_surfaces` reflects the new
 * surface — cannot pick a key already in flight. `selectCandidates` removing
 * intra-batch duplicates covers a duplicate-in-one-list; the synchronous active-set
 * insert at the call site covers the spawn-not-yet-visible window. Both are required.
